# ModularMC
A opensource lightweight minecraft server. Powerful when extreme customization and little vanilla features are required.
Focused on easy customization and maximum preformance.

# Development Stages
- Core server (Backbone, Gameobjects (world entites), Chat etc) (CURRENTLY HERE)
- Customization (Add the mod(plugin) system)
- Preformance and optimizations. Finding and fixing bugs, security issues etc.

# To contribute
Just make pullrequest but write detailed what you have done to spare me time looking though the code.
If really advance non obvious stuff write simple comments.

# Possible assignments
Best way to help is to find bugs, bottlenecks, security leaks etc... And if possible fix them.
I want this to be simple but state of the art in perfomance and relaibility.
